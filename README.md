Unofficial Rust crate for accessing [Xen Orchestra](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra) through its API

## Under development
The library is still in early development, please do not use in production. The API is nowhere near complete and only covers
a very small fraction of XO's api. Lots of things might get changed and/or added in breaking ways at any time.

### Async Runtime
This library uses the tokio v1 runtime
